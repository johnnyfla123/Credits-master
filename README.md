# What are Credits? #

Credits are a type of currency that are created and stored in computers, by downloading the wallet you yourself can store and even create your own. There are many ways you can get Credits, the most common way is through a process called “mining”. Using this method, your computer solves complex mathematical equations, completion results in reward, and the economy prospers. After getting them, Credits can be spent on a wide array of items in the official Credit Marketplace, a kind of crypto-Etsy, as well as traded interpersonally and in time, used in physical stores. With the advent of Cryptocurrencies and the exponentially increasing difficulty of mining bitcoin the net has flooded with alternative solutions. Unfortunately, the crypto-world has become littered with scam coins, pump and dump schemes, and unstable financial bubbles. WIth an algorithm designed to limit both the overwhelming advantage of early adopters and the rapidly diminishing returns that characterise current Cryptos, Credits are made to serve the general public as well as enthusiasts. Using our algorithms to change block rewards cyclically, increasing and decreasing over time. This design ensures healthy market activity and prosperous mining for newcomers and veterans alike.

# Roadmap #

1.  Sort a few things out.
    * ~~Name the currency~~
    * ~~Block Time - This is the average target time between blocks. Usually you set it 
between 15 sec and 2 mins.~~
    * ~~Difficulty Retarget Time -  This is important, since otherwise it could cause serious instamine problem. (Diff. Retarget Time)/(Block Time) gives you how many blocks a diff retarget will happen. This is an important parameter to consider.~~
    * ~~What will be the initial coin per block? People set it to 2 to 100, usually. Could be anything. Can also be set to do coins per block based on the block number, or even randomly (like JKC/LKY etc).~~
    * How long you want coins per block be halved. Usually it's 6 month to 3 years. 
    * ~~Ports, you need two: connection and RPC ports. Choose the ones that are not used in common apps.~~
    * Agree on Final set of features for Credits to have.
    * Get the source code for the coin sorted out with the features that it need.
4. Finalize a website to promote Credits and eventually host the software and tutorials.
5. Create an official marketplace and have it linked to the official site and WalletMiner
6. Create a wallet app for Smartphone OS’s
7. Test that everythings runs smoothly
8. Launch.
